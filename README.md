Skin Cancer Detection
Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for detecting skin cancer from dermatoscopic images. Using advanced image processing and deep learning algorithms, the model classifies skin lesions as either benign or malignant, helping in the early detection of skin cancer.
Features

    Image Preprocessing: Standardizes and enhances images for better feature extraction.
    Deep Learning Model: Implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify skin lesions.
    Prediction: Provides the classification result with a confidence score (benign or malignant).
    Model Evaluation: Uses performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model efficiency.

Technologies

    Python: Primary programming language.
    TensorFlow/Keras: Framework for building and training the deep learning model.
    OpenCV: Used for image preprocessing and manipulation.
    Scikit-learn: For evaluating model performance.
    Flask/Django (Optional): For web-based user interface and predictions.

Dataset

The model is trained using the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset, which contains labeled skin lesion images. The dataset includes both benign and malignant lesions, making it suitable for classification tasks.
